# The History of the Tottenham ⚪📉⚰️

A rigorously documented multimedia museum chronicling the long and storied tradition of nearly winning things. This interactive web application offers an exhaustive exploration of Tottenham Hotspur’s contribution to comedy, footballing folklore, and fourth-place finishes.

> “To dare is to bottle it in the semi-final.”

## 📚 Featured Exhibits

- ⏱️ **Trophy Drought Timer**  
  A live digital chronograph counting the years, days, hours, and seconds since Tottenham last touched a trophy in anger (2008, a time before TikTok, VAR, and some of their fans were even born).

- 🤡 **Statistical Banter Engine**  
  A button that delivers cold, hard numbers — each one a dagger of reality. Powered by data, sarcasm, and Spurs' inability to win when it matters.

- 💀 **The Collapse Archive™**  
  An interactive collection of famous faceplants, bottlings, and European exits — all lovingly linked to actual news reports for historical verification and viewer despair.

- 🎭 **Signings of the Season**  
  Explore a carousel of flops, frauds, and faded hopes. Each card lovingly designed in the style of Top Trumps — just without the "trump" part.

- 💿 **Spurs’ Greatest Moments: The DVD**  
  A rotating playlist of awkward highlights, calamity goals, and tragic commentary — all available in glorious 480p, just like the glory days.

- 🎺 **Auditory Grief Buttons**  
  Tap to experience sad trombones, violin loops, and a mysterious Australian man saying “who mate?” whenever the site updates.

- 🏆 **Trophy Cabinet Simulator (404)**  
  Explore the emptiest interactive experience on the web. Not found — much like their silverware since 1991.
