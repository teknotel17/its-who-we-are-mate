## ⚰️ 100% Genuine Roadmap

_These features are 100% optional, 0% necessary, and deeply cursed._

- 🎮 **Ange Postecoglou’s Set Piece Master** — a JavaScript tower defence game where you concede from every corner
- 🕶️ **The Tottenham Hotspur VR Trophy Room Tour** — bring your own headset and disappointment
- 🧀 **The Interactive Cheese Room Experience™** — click cheese, get tears
- 📉 **Trophy Stock Market Simulator** — buy low, cry lower
- 🛒 **Spurs Shop RNG** — every time you buy a jersey, you get a different underwhelming player name
- 🧠 **SpursGPT** — an AI that insists “it’s our year” no matter what
- 🧼 **Daniel Levy Simulator** — say "no" to every signing
- 🧟 **Harry Kane Ghost Mode** — he haunts the penalty area but never returns
